My name is Victor Figueroa I am from Immokalee Florida, I enrolled in the Computer Systems & Information Technology class to expand my knowledge in the world of tech and to grow my skills as an individual to mold myself into an asset for a company and provide vaule towards their goals. My own professional goals are to start as an entry level helpdesk or entry level technican in any compaany. While builidng my skills and networking within the company I will look to stay with that company for two to three years depending on the knowledge I've aquired, this way I can seek another company that is willing increase my salary. I would follow this model until i reached a point where i could work remotely work from anywhere and allow myself the time to work when i am most needed. During this i would also continue growing my side hustle of repaing electroics as a I do now to help occupy my free time and possibly grow into my own repiar company that i could then outsource over time once I am ready to expand, or aquire a bigger workload. These goals may be subject to change but for the moment they are what i have currently set until otherwise.
